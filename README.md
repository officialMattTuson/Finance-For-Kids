### Welcome to Finance For Kids

-------------------

##The idea:

What is compound interest??  Ask a normal 10 year old that and they probably won’t know.  It can be surprising how long some people remain in the dark about basic knowledge of money and the responsibility required to make, maintain and grow monetary portfolios.  Kids Finance (pending name change)is an application designed to get kids talking about money, with exposure to money talk, investing, business terminology and general financing information.

-------------------

##How the App will work:

I envision this app to facilitate a wide age range from early schooling to the end of high school.  A simple question where you select your age bracket, and a site tailored to that bracket will be viewed by the user.  Early ages will be more kid friendly, with bigger fonts, smaller words, simple terminology and pictures to demonstrate.  Sophistication increases with age.
Another aspect of the app will be similar to a family banking app where administrators AKA parents can set up accounts for their users AKA children and this can be used as a tool to deposit pocket money and other allowances.  Currently, there is no plan to integrate a real way to hold money so all monetary values contained in the app would be up to the parents to distribute at the appropriate time.

-------------------

## Scenario:

1. A parent decides to provide an allowance to a child
2. The child has an account created on the app along with the parent as admin
3. The parent begins adding money to the child’s account
4. The child can view the money in their account and have access to certain requests they can submit to their admins to verify.
5. Potential submission requests could be:

i.  Withdrawals
ii. Investment Options
iii Interest Options 

6. A reason text field can be required to be completed in order for request to be submitted and eventually accepted
7. Investment and Interest Options can be displayed to the child along with learning tools to assist them
8. Withdrawals can be dealt with by parent admins as they wish.  Generally, fork out the money parents

## What this application will use:

-------------------

This app will use a Material UI styling framework to create a well structured and streamlined interface for our users to interact with.
React will be our front end language we use to complete this application.  This will be combined with Redux to hold better control over information that may be needed by multiple components and can affect their ability to work together
External API’s will be used later in the project when development learning material accessible by users and admins.  This learning specifically pertains to investment options and sourcing history for public financial data.
Auth0 or Authenticare will be used as the service to allow users to login and out of the service
SQLite3 will be used build our backend databases
Node.js and Express will be used to round out the stack
